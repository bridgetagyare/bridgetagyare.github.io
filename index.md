Hi! My name is Bridget Agyare (pronounced A-jar-ee), and I am a first-year Computer Science PhD candidate in the Computers and Education group at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in CS education, with a focus on broadening participation in computing. Previously, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by Dr. Gireeja Ranade.<br><br>
